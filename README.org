* Why

This repo provides basic commands  for getting program coverage info.. I tested the commands below on Ubuntu 16. Three styles are illsutrated.


* How

- Run "make cov0" to see how to use gcc to get the coverage info and then to use lcov to get the report

- Run "make cov1" to see how to use Clang for a gcov-style coverage info

- Run "make cov2" to see how to get an alternative, more visual,  form of coverage info

- Run "make clean" to remove generated file during coverage profiling

- See Makefile to get details
