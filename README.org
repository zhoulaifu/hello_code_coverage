* Why

This repo aims to provide basic commands  for getting program coverage info. Clang-6.0 is assumed to have been installed. I tested the commands below on Ubuntu 16.


* How


- Run "make cov1" to see how to use Clang for a gcov-style coverage info

- Run "make cov2" to see how to get an alternative, more visual,  form of coverage info

- Run "make clean" to remove generated file during coverage profiling

- See Makefile to get details
